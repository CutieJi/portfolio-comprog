        <u>Origin of Internet?</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b><i>Internet</i></b> has evolved through the need of <b><u><i>advance technology</i></u></b>
        in communication during the Cold War. The Department of Defense of the
        United States funded <b><u><i>ARPA</i></u></b> to research on network technologies that would
        <i>continuously</i> transmit messages or information to its final destination unless any part of
        the network was destroyed. This results to easy communication in military operation.

        <u>Why is Internet so Popular?</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        It offers <b><u>massive information</u></b>. You can get information for free or for a fee.
        You can go to a specific place without traveling and spending money to reach it.
        You can visit or even tour to different libraries all over the World or you can
        just get the information written by the experts by simply downloading it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b><i>tools</i></b> or the
        <b><i>facilities for communications</i></b> are the major reasons why
        Internet became popular. One example is <b><i>e-mail</i></b>. This tool has made a big
        impact on communication. You can send messages or talk to a distant person
        over a second at minimal cost, unlike with long distance calls, which cost you
        hundreds or thousands of your money.
